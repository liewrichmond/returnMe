# returnMe

A website for a service that picks up packages and does returns for you.

## Sales Pitch
Doing returns sucks. Yes, there are package pickup services provided by main logistics handlers but do you really want to call 4 different services to do different pickups?
You could do it yourself, but now you'd need to stop at the Amazon drop off, the UPS store and swing by the USPS store on your way home. 

This service solves that. Embrace the laziness. Have people do things for you.

## Why? 
My passion for coding burns deep in my heart if I don't code I will die. Recruiters take note...
